# About Stat 151a

Statistics 151A is an upper-division undergraduate course on linear modeling. Topics include the geometry and statistical theory of Gaussian linear models, model selection and shrinkage, diagnostics, logistic regression, and regression splines; students are also required to conduct a substantial amount of data analysis and visualization in R and to give coherent verbal interpretations of linear modeling results. 


## Goals

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

1.	Understand the purposes and benefits of linear modeling in common applied contexts.
2.	Design and conduct regression analyses in R for common data settings.
3.	Interpret statistical models, estimates of model parameters, and inferences correctly.
4.	Evaluate the quality of a regression analysis and suggest improvements.
5.	Communicate the process and results of a data analysis simply and clearly for a broad audience, using well-organized prose and code and effective data visualizations.

## Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. **Prerequisites will be enforced in Stat 151a. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites.**
- Stat 135 and its other prequisite courses (including Stat 134).
- Linear algebra including matrix operations, vector subspaces and projections, rank and invertibility of matrices, and quadratic forms.
- Familiarity with R (Stat 133 is recommended).
